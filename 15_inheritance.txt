Inheritance
-------------------------------------------------------
One of the most important concepts in
object-oriented programming is that of inheritance. 

Inheritance allows us to define a class
in terms of another class which makes it
easier to create and maintain an application. 

This also provides an opportunity to reuse
the code functionality and fast implementation time.

When creating a class, instead of writing completely
new data members and member functions, the programmer
can designate that the new class should inherit the 
members of an existing class. 

This existing class is called the base class, and the
new class is referred to as the derived class.
